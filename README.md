# Hello-World
This is an update of the readme.md file
You can modify it directly in the main branch. It's better for the purpose I'm looking for. Less complicated.

Adding lines is easy directly in the main branch. You don't have to commit, ideal for using as a note taking.

Ajout depuis Atom sur le Mac.
